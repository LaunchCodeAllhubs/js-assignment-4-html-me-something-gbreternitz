         <p> Skyball 2 is a conceptual video game that came to me in a dream. It is the sequel to Skyball, a game that does not 
            and never will exist.</p>
         <p> This is its story. </p>

            <h2>The Concept</h2>
            <p>It's a game where the world is a 2d side scroller, 
               and you can occasionally stop the game, pull on the ground's horizon, 
               and launch your little character like a slingshot.</p>

            <h2>The ArtStyle</h2>
            <p>Cartoony, likely, but with an element of psychadelic hyper-realism. 
               Idk what that means either, but think FunRun meets Borderlands.</p>
