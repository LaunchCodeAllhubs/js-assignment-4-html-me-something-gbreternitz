         <p> Skyball 2 is a conceptual video game that came to me in a dream. It is the sequel to 
            <b><span style="color:rgb(199, 28, 191)">Skyball</span></b>, a game that does not 
            and never will exist.</p>
         <p> This is its story. </p>

            <h2>The Concept</h2>
            <p>It's a game where the world is a 3D open world, but
               you can occasionally reach Jump Points. When you reach a Jump Point, the game clock slows, the camera compresses sideways, and
               the view transforms into 2D - at which point you can pull down on the ground itself and launch your 
               little character like a slingshot.</p>
            <p>This is the main point of the game - find a jump point, launch your character, and  collect Skyballs</p>

            <h2>The ArtStyle</h2>
            <p>Cartoony, likely, but with an element of psychadelic hyper-realism. 
               Idk what that means either, but think <a href="https://www.dirtybit.com/funrun3">FunRun</a> meets 
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderlands_(series)"> Borderlands.</a></p>
